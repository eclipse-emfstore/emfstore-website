				Open-source software is free of licensing fees. Furthermore, it is
				easy to adapt and enhance with new features. Nevertheless, using
				open-source frameworks is not for free. Like in closed-source
				software, no one is an expert on every framework. The total
				cost of ownership also includes training, adoption, enhancement and
				maintainance of a framework. It might take significantly more time for
				somebody new to the project to extend a certain feature than for the
				person who is familiar with the framework. Furthermore, software
				has to be maintained. Even if this can be done literally by
				everybody for open-source software, a professional maintainance
				agreement with fixed response times is often mandatory in an
				industrial setting. This ensures your productivity. EclipseSource
				employs several EMFStore committers and
