<h2>How to use the EMFStore examples</h2>
<p> 
In this tutorial you will learn how to use the EMFStore example.
Follow the steps below to setup emfstore, import the example projects into workspace and to run them.<br> 
</p>

<b>Step 1: Get EMF Store and EMF Client Platform</b>
	<p>
	This tutorial will assume that you have a running Eclipse with the plugins EMF Store and EMF Client Platform installed, and that you know how to create and share a new project in the EMF Client Platform.<br>
	Please refer to the setup tutorials to get started.

<b>Step 2: Importing the examples</b>
<p>
If you followed both tutorials above step by step, importing the examples into workspace is really simple. 
Just use the &quot;New example wizard&quot; and all steps are done automatically.<br><br><em>&quot;right Click &gt;&gt;&gt; New  &gt;&gt;&gt; Example&quot;</em>.
</p>
<p><img src="images/emfstore-examples-newexample-wizard-0.png" style="height: 341px; width: 468px; "></p>And then selected the example to be imported.<em>&quot;Next &gt;&gt;&gt; Finish&quot;</em>.
<br><br><img src="images/emfstore-examples-newexample-wizard-1.png" style="height: 386px; width: 387px; "><br><br>And as a result, the project will be created in the workspace.<br><br><br><img src="images/emfstore-examples-projectstructure.png" style="height: 421px; width: 658px; "><br><br>
<b>Step 3: Project structure</b>
<p>
The structure of the example project is really simple. The source folder contains the example application. <br>All required launchconfigs to run the example are contained in the launch folder.<br>You have to decide between launchconfigs for developers and launch configs for users. If you have been following the steps above, the &quot;user launchconfigs&quot; are responsible for you. But if you are using a clone of the git respository, then you have to use the developer launch configs.</p>

<b>Step 4: Run  the example client</b>
<p>
To run the example, you have to process two steps.
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Run the EMFStore server</li>
		<li>Run the EMFStore example</li>
	</ul>To run the server, just run the launchconfig of the appropriate  example. To start the server of the helloworld example, run the launchconfig &quot;EMFStore ExampleClientServer - user - helloworld.launch&quot;.<br>And to run the example itself, start &quot;EMFStore ExampleClient - user - helloworld.launch&quot;<br><br><br>

<b>Step 5: Examples</b>
</p><ul>
		<li>Basic example (hello world) - demos how to use the EMFStores API</li>
			<ol></ol>
		<li>Merging example - demos how conflicts can be produced, handled and resolved</li>
	</ul>
	A new example for "sessionprovider" is in work right now. If you have any ideas about required examples, just let us know!
